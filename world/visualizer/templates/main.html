        <h2>Towards Trust - Experiment</h2>
        <h4>Goal</h4>
        <p>The goal of the game is to find victims and drop them IN ORDER at the currect drop off location (as indicated in the image) as fast as possible.</p>
        <p>You are partnered with a robot called "RescueBot" which will help you in your rescue operation.</p>
        <p>The game will automatically stop after 10 minutes if not all victims were rescued. After the game you will be redirected to a short questionnaire.</p>
        <p>For clarification, green victims are healthy and do not need to be rescued.</p>
        <img src="/static/images/tutorial.png" alt="tutorial">
        <h4>Actions</h4>
        <p>You can move using either the WASD keys or the arrow keys.</p>
        <p>You can pickup people using Q and drop them using E.</p>
        <p>You can only see people when they are 1 block away from you (in a + shape), that includes RescueBot. Meaning, you have to go through the entire room to see if it contains any vicitm.</p>
        <h4>Communication</h4>
        <p>You can communicate with RescueBot using buttons.</p>
        <img src="/static/images/tutorial2.png" alt="tutorial", style="width: 50%">
        <p>Communicating will help you and RescueBot rescue victims faster.</p>
        <p>RescueBot will have no information as to which rooms you have searched and which victims you have saved or found if you do not communicate it.</p>
        <h4>RescueBot's limitions</h4>
        <p>RescueBot cannot carry the critically injured (red) adults/elders.</p>
        <p>You will be able to assist RescueBot and also accept/deny his suggestions.</p>
        <h4>Consent Form</h4>
        <p>You can find how we use your data in this <a href="/consent_form">consent form</a>.</p>
        <p>Click on start if you agree to this consent form and are ready to start the experiment.</p>
